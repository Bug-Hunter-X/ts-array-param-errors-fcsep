This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common error when using arrays as function parameters. The error occurs because the function `greeter` expects a single string as an argument, but the variable `user` is an array of strings. To fix the error, modify the function to accept an array of strings as an argument.  The solution demonstrates how to fix this and other potential issues.
